# Your makefile doesn't build your code. I
# have to give you a zero. Sorry. It looks like
# you know what you're doing in this file, but
# I'll be glad to help if you need anything. Once
# you get the makefile working properly, be sure
# to add all the compile flags that Boyd went over
# in class. Those will be required on all assignments now.
